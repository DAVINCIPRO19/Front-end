"Foggy Albion" is a kind of guarantee of getting a high-quality education and further prospects for graduates.</div>
					<br><br>

					<div><h3>EDUCATION SYSTEM AND TYPES OF PROGRAMS</h3><br></div>
					<div>Studying in the UK is considered very expensive, and all because it is incredibly popular all over the world. The system of obtaining knowledge is based on the development of the ability to think logically, not to memorize. Students at all levels conduct research to come to conclusions and be able to formulate them - this is the key to the success of any student. After graduation, students understand their specialty 100% and can compete at the world level in the labor market.</div>
					<div><b>SECONDARY EDUCATION</b><br>Secondary education in the UK includes 12 years of schooling. The last 2 years of study are the most important. The high school program is called A-Level and includes the study of 6-8 subjects (required and optional). Final grades for these subjects are the basis for admission to the undergraduate university.Also, an alternative to A-Level was the receipt of IB (International Baccalaureate) - a kind of world-class certificate - accepted in any country for direct admission to a university. To obtain this diploma, you must study for 2 years. IB is considered the most difficult program, although it includes only 6 subjects.</div>
					<div><b>If a student has completed 11 classes</b> of study in his country, he cannot immediately enter the first year of university in a general stream with British students. He needs to supplement his knowledge. In this case, the student passes the Foundation program (annual preparation for admission), the International Year One program (first international year: combination of foundation and first year), or goes to high school and graduates from A-Level or IB.</div>
					<div><b>HIGHER EDUCATION</b><br>Undergraduate or graduate studies in the UK are elite and incredibly prestigious throughout the world.The system is based on theoretical, practical exercises. An important condition is the student's independent work, which is given a huge place in the construction of tasks and the structure of training itself.</div>
					<div><b>Undergraduate</b> - duration 3 years.<br>Students receive a degree faster than in many countries of the world, due to the fact that the program is clearly formed and does not include general subjects - only what is needed for this specialty. This is very attractive to many foreigners - after all, living expenses are reduced by 1 year.</div>
					<div><b>Master's program</b> - duration 1 year.<br>The master's program is very concentrated and is structured as follows: 9 months studying theory and 3 months writing a dissertation. The Master program (Master's program) in the UK is the most popular on the world stage, as it is one of the most prestigious and shortest in duration. The quality of training remains at the highest level.</div>
