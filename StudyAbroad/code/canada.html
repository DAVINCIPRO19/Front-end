					<div><h3>Facts about Canada</h3><br></div>
					<div><b>Capital: </b>Ottawa</div>
					<div><b>Currency: </b>Canadian Dollar (CAD)</div>
					<div><b>Number of provinces: </b>10 provinces and 3 territories</div>
					<div><b>Largest city: </b>Toronto</div>
					<div><b>Population: </b>37 million</div>
					<br>
					<div><b>Canada</b> is a huge country (second place in the world), which is developing every day and is happy to accept young talents from around the world. Indigenous Canadians are only 30% of the population. That is why Canada is considered the most favorable country for international students.</div>
					<br><br>
				</div>
				<div>
					<div><h3>WHY CHOOSE THE CANADA?</h3><br></div>

					<div><b>Flexible higher education system</b></div>
					<div><b>Practical orientation of training and participation of trade unions in curriculum development</b></div>
					<div><b>The cost of training is 40% lower than in the UK and USA</b></div>
					<div><b>The opportunity to stay at work after training for 3 years with the prospect of obtaining a residence permit</b></div>
					<div><b>The highest level of security in the country</b></div>
					<div><b>Leader in the number of investments in education and educational institutions</b></div>
					<br><br>
				</div>

					<div><h3>EDUCATION SYSTEM AND TYPES OF PROGRAMS</h3><br></div>
					<div>Schools in Canada should be divided into private and public. Both types provide quality education, but differ in cost and number of students in the class. Public schools, colleges and universities provide more personalized instruction and, as a rule, the number of people in classes does not exceed 30-40 people.The education system in each province of Canada is different, since each has its own Ministry of Education. This means that each province has its own entry requirements and internal regulations, but the country's general education system can be divided into the following levels.</div>
					<div><b>SECONDARY EDUCATION</b><br>A secondary school in Canada lasts 12 years, which means that not always our students can immediately enter the first year in rating educational institutions, but Canada is a very flexible country for foreigners, so direct entry options always exist.The overwhelming majority of schoolchildren attend public schools, as this option is absolutely free for local citizens. For foreign students, the cost of tuition will vary from 15,000 CAD per year for tuition alone, and this applies to both public and private schools. It is important to note that foreign students studying in public schools have the right to live only in the host family or with their Canadian guardian, and private schools can offer students comfortable dormitories and residences on the campus of the educational institutions themselves.The languages ​​of instruction at the Canadian mid-level are English or French, depending on the province of residence. To study in middle and high school, students from Kazakhstan must have a good level of knowledge of the language. Sometimes, for admission to higher-rated private schools, additional tests are required in general or major subjects.</div>
					<div><b>HIGHER EDUCATION</b><br>Higher education in Canada is represented by two main types of educational institutions - Colleges and Universities.When choosing a program, it is important to understand that a college is a higher educational institution that also provides not only Diploma programs (2 years), but also practical undergraduate programs. A university differs from a college in that it conducts research. This is important for such specialties as Biology, Ecology, Architecture and other scientific specializations. The bulk of the Canadian population never graduates from university, but graduates from college, as this is a more profitable option - colleges are decently cheaper.</div>
					<div><b>Universities</b><br>Universities in Canada are scientifically oriented and attract many scientists from all over the world. Even the smallest institutions of higher education invest enormous amounts of money in research and development and compete with universities in the USA and Great Britain, while offering a more budgetary education. In total, Canada offers about 100 universities for undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees.</div>
